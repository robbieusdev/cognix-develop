Our mission is to augment humans with AI.

## `What's CognixDevelop`
AI can be difficult to use, CognixDevelop fills the gap that there is between humans and AI.

Now it would be nice to quickly find my notes and related manuals to solve the issue....
Probably you spent more time chasing your notes than actually solving the issue :)
